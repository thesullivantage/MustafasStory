## React
- Gatsby
- Layout component
    - Logic: 
        - Populate 3 x 3 react grid with text, images 
        - In doing so, make it so **components have unique row, column**
    - If props (whole component) (images exist)
        - Pass in rows (props) to logic for layout
    -  Else: Randomized rows logic (lifecycle function)
    - Addtl. Props: Offset margins for individual photos
    - Fade in text, have binary prop (cond. rendering): use/notuse; prop for speed of fade 
        - Might need whole child component for this to pass into
        - Prebuilt components ?
- parent component for trigger animation, pagination


## Layout
- Mustard yellow background
- Text elements overlap each other
