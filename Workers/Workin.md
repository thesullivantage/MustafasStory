- split at question via &&
    - extract last
- simultaneously extract title and piece 

    Data Technique & Structure: 
    - split entire string by **
    - (extract- different method?) split off first line between first line's text and first line break: title
    - other line breaks become the next split criteria for "pieces"
        - 2 types of pagination:
            - between line breaks
            - between 
    - piecewise analysis of little paragraphs by # of periods
        - small threshold, 


-dynamically splitting up actual pieces 

{
    title: "x"
    prompt: bool
    linkTo: "x"
}

 {
    "title": "",
    "prompt": true,
    "text": "",
    "links": []
}
